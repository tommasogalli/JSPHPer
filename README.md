# JSPHPer /ˈjæspər/.
JSPHPer is a quite poor but very easy to use client for OpenAI ChatGPT with Embedding API enabled on text files. 
It only use that just use JS &amp; PHP.

You have 5 files and 1 folder for context.

- index.html with the main page
- style.css 
- config.php where to put your API key
- gpt_api.php to speak with OpenAI GPT3.5Turbo
- embedding_api.php to perform the search within your text files
- script.js to make things work in general
- context/example.txt

I don't code since a while so the whole thing is actually beein written by GPT4 itself, i just ask politley and guide a lot into the debugging.

As i mention is not meant to be something serious just something you can play with to understand a bit how it works.
