# JSPHPer /ˈjæspər/.
JSPHPer is a quite poor but very easy to use client for OpenAI ChatGPT with Embedding API enabled on text files.
It only uses JS &amp; PHP.

You have 5 files and 1 folder for context.

- index.html with the main page
- style.css
- config.php where to put your API key
- gpt_api.php to speak with OpenAI GPT3.5 Turbo
- embedding_api.php to perform the search within your text files
- script.js to make things work in general
- context/example.txt

I haven't code for a while so the whole thing is actually being written by GPT4 itself, I just ask politely and guide a lot into the debugging.

This is not meant to be something serious, just something you can play with to understand a bit how it works.
